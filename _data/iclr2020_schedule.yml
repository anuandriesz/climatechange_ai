      <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk we examine the the human cost of climate change and explore a number of technological interventions aimed at improving the monitoring of ecosystems. In particular we focus on the use of bioacoustic approaches to environmental monitoring and describe efforts currently underway in Kenya to develop a decision support system for ecosystem management that uses audio recordings collected in the ecosystems of interest to infer ecosystem health. We also explore the use of internet of things for water resource monitoring and improved agriculture which are essential if we are to lessen the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities.

      Care About Weather: A New Approach for Africa</b></a> <em>(Invited talk)</em>'
    more: |-
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> By improving weather services in Africa, we have the potential to unlock hundreds billions of dollars of opportunity for the continent, and, in turn, lift millions from poverty by helping individuals, businesses and governments proactively manage weather risk and adapt to changing weather patterns. While there have been significant technological advancements in weather forecasting globally  in recent years through the use of supercomputers, AI and user-facing tools, these benefits are yet to reach their full potential in Africa.

                <p>
                During this presentation for the Climate Change AI community, Georgina shares ClimaCell’s novel approach to bringing weather innovations to Africa’s hydro-met value chain. Through a set of powerful stories, she shares a community-level perspective of the game-changing socio-economic value that could be achieved with better forecasts, especially among vulnerable communities. She presents a new systems lense for how to view this opportunity by better understanding the problem, with the goal of inspiring the Climate Change AI community to contribute to this critical, but perhaps underappreciated, aspect of the climate adaptation agenda. Weather can drive people into poverty. Knowing the weather can lift them out.

                Georgina Campbell Flatter will be joined by her colleague Daniel Rothenberg for the Q&A portion of this talk.

      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent technological developments are
                creating new spatio-temporal data streams that contain a wealth of
                information relevant to climate adaptation strategies. Modern AI
                techniques have the potential to yield accurate, inexpensive, and
                highly scalable models to inform research and policy. A key challenge,
                however, is the lack of large quantities of labeled data that often
                characterize successful machine learning applications. In this talk, I
                will present new approaches for learning useful spatio-temporal models
                in contexts where labeled training data is scarce or not available at
                all. I will show applications to predict and map poverty in developing
                countries, monitor agricultural productivity and food security
                outcomes, and map infrastructure access in Africa. Our methods can
                reliably predict economic well-being using only high-resolution
                satellite imagery. Because images are passively collected in every
                corner of the world, our methods can provide timely and accurate
                measurements in a very scalable end economic way, and could
                significantly improve the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts.

    more: |-
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> When we think “ML for climate change”, we often think of climate forecasting, energy grid optimization, greenhouse gas reduction, and other opportunities for ML to impact the <i>direct</i> causes and effects of global warming. But in this talk, I will present the close relationships among <i>climate</i>, <i>biodiversity</i>, and <i>land use</i>, and I will discuss opportunities for ML to support climate change mitigation by accelerating efforts in all three of these areas. Furthermore, this workshop’s mission states that “many in the ML community wish to take action on climate change, yet feel their skills are inapplicable”; I hope to convince the audience that one of the best ways we can put ML to work – and often the easiest way for ML students and practitioners to get hands-on experience with environmental sustainability – is to focus on some of the “small” problems whose solutions will make the day-to-day work of conservation scientists and practitioners more efficient.

    desc: Machine Learning for Sustainable and Resilient Built Infrastructure in Urban
      Areas
    more: |-
      The built infrastructure is a critical component of climate policies, both 
      because of the large energy use of buildings and because of vulnerability to 
      extreme weather events. However, access to good data about buildings can be 
      a bottleneck in designing effective policies. Machine learning can contribute 
      to a sustainable and resilient built infrastructure by gathering individual 
      data on millions of buildings. This session will discuss ways to monitor infrastructure 
      with remote sensing, and to upscale building energy use modeling to the city 
      scale.

    url: https://youtu.be/22DeBWOgu5M
    more: |-
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite their wide applicability, many deep networks often fail to exactly capture simple "known" features of real-world data sets, such as those governed by physical laws.  In this talk, I'll present methods for integrating constraints such as physical simulation requirements <i>directly</i> into the predictions of a deep network.  Our tool for doing this will be the use of so-called implicit layers in deep models, layers that are defined implicitly in terms of conditions we would like them to satisfy, rather than via an explicit computation graph.  I'll discuss how we can use these layers to embed (exact) physical simulation within deep networks, discuss several related approaches, and highlight directions for future work.

              <p>
              <strong>Speaker Bio:</strong> Zico Kolter is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, and also serves as chief scientist of AI research for the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence. His work spans the intersection of machine learning and optimization, with a large focus on developing more robust and rigorous methods in deep learning. In addition, he has worked in a number of application areas, highlighted by work on sustainability and smart energy systems. He is a recipient of the DARPA Young Faculty Award, a Sloan Fellowship, and best paper awards at NeurIPS, ICML (honorable mention), IJCAI, KDD, and PESGM.

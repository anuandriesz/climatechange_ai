        University and her Ph.D. in Geographical Science at the University of
        Maryland. Most recently, she was awarded the 2020 Africa Food Prize
        (AFP) for her contributions to the promotion of food security across
        the continent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Nakalembe has broad interests including agriculture, food security,
        remote sensing, and climate change. She has worked with the World Bank
        Environment Group and Climate Change Unit, The Nature Conservancy,
        Washington Adventist University, The United Nations Development Program
        (UNDP) and the NASA LCLUC program. She is currently working with
        government agencies in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda as a co-investigator
        on the NASA SERVIR Applied Sciences Team and NASA Harvest. She also

      <p>
        Dr. Nakalembe's doctoral research focused on drought and its impacts on
        land use and livelihoods in the Karamoja region of North Eastern
        Uganda. She pioneered the repurposing of remote sensing by unmanned
        aerial vehicles (UAVs) from agricultural monitoring, to the survey of
        major refugee camps in her native Uganda.

      <p>
        Climate Change AI (CCAI) is a group of volunteers from academia and
        industry who believe that tackling climate change requires concerted
        societal action, in which machine learning can play an impactful role.
        Since it was founded in June 2019, CCAI has led the creation of a
        global movement in climate change and machine learning, encompassing
        researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers,
        companies, and NGOs.

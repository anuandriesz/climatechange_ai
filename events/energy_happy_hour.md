# Virtual Happy Hour on Energy, Climate Change, and Machine Learning

## Tuesday, August 4 @ 5:30-7:30pm Eastern Time

Join link: <https://www.climatechange.ai/join/happyhour>{:target="_blank"}

Join us via Zoom for a virtual happy hour focused on topics at the intersection of climate change, power and energy systems, and machine learning. This event will serve as an opportunity to network and engage in discussions with others interested in these topics. Whether you are a veteran in this area or would like to learn more, we hope to see you there! 

This event is organized by [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/){:target="_blank"}, and will be held in parallel to the [2020 IEEE PES General Meeting](https://pes-gm.org/2020/){:target="_blank"}. Attendance is free of charge.

## Additional details

As evidenced by the theme of this yearâ€™s IEEE PES General Meeting, there are many ways in which machine learning (ML) is transforming the power grid. This transformation has large impacts for climate change, both in terms of mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (building resilience to unavoidable consequences). For instance, ML has been used to:
- Facilitate low-carbon grid management by providing renewables forecasts and fast power system optimization algorithms.
- Reduce system waste via predictive maintenance and methane leak detection.
- Expedite the development of next-generation batteries and solar panels via accelerated science techniques.
- Optimize power systems for resilience to hurricanes and other extreme events.

The [Climate Change AI virtual happy hour](https://www.climatechange.ai/join/happyhour){:target="_blank"} on energy, climate change, and machine learning will provide a venue for networking among students and professionals who work in these areas or are interested in learning more.  We will start by giving a 15-minute overview of topics at the intersection of these areas, drawing on the applications and taxonomy provided in ["Tackling climate change with machine learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05433.pdf){:target="_blank"}, before splitting participants into breakout rooms for small-group conversations.

# Climate Change AI Happy Hour Series

## Next event: Wednesday 20 January @ 5:00-6:00 Eastern Time/11:00pm CET

Join us via Gather.Town for our regular virtual happy hour community events taking place on the first and third Wednesday of every month.

The timing will rotate to accomodate different time zones. On the first Wednesday of each month, the Happy Hour will take place from 12:30pm - 1:30pm ET / 5:30pm - 6:30pm GMT. On the third Wednesday, the Happy Hour will take place from 5pm - 6pm ET / 10pm-11pm GMT. 

The events aim to provide an informal space for people to network and engage in discussions with others interested in or currently working at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. They are open to all and we hope to see you there!

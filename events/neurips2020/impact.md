Climate Change AI aims “To empower work that meaningfully addresses the climate crisis and is well-served by machine learning tools.”

## Illustrate the link to climate impact
Many types of work, from highly theoretical to deeply applied, fit under this umbrella. What they all have in common is a clear pathway to climate change impact. This link may be very direct, such as improving solar forecasting to make it easier for the electric grid to take in high levels of solar electricity. This link may take a few steps to explain, such as improved computer vision techniques for classification of different types of clouds, which could create enormously useful datasets for climate scientists seeking to understand the fundamental dynamics of the climate.

## Convey the big picture
Climate Change AI is building a community of thoughtful researchers and practitioners in machine learning and in numerous other domains, in academia, industry, government, and beyond, who keep an eye on the big picture as they thoughtfully apply machine learning to problems that will help humanity address climate change.

## How can you reach your target audience?
In your submission to the NeurIPS 2020 workshop, try to convey to the reader with relative specificity why and to whom solving the problem at hand will be useful. If you are studying extreme weather prediction, think of how you would communicate your key findings to a government disaster response agency. If you are presenting results of a supply chain optimization pilot program, what are the main takeaways for industries who might adopt this technology?

In order to make sure your work will actually be impactful, where possible, we highly recommend co-developing projects with your target audience/relevant stakeholders or reaching out to them starting early in the process for feedback. We encourage you to use this opportunity to reach out!

## Outline key metrics
Quantitative assessments of how well your results (or for proposals, anticipated results) compare to existing methods are highly encouraged, as this will give a sense of the importance of the problem at hand and your findings. We encourage you to convey why the particular metrics you choose are relevant from a climate change perspective; for instance, how does improved accuracy on a machine learning model translate to climate impact, and is accuracy necessarily the best measure to use?

## Be clear and concise
The discussion of pathway to impact does not need to be lengthy. It just needs to be clear and it should not read like an afterthought. 

## Start with the end in mind
The most useful papers often start from this big picture view, which then guides the rest of the analysis. We are hoping to instill this approach as the norm within the Climate Change AI community.

paper_title: Non-linear interlinkages and key objectives amongst the Paris Agreement
  and the Sustainable Development Goals
abstract: "The United Nations' ambitions to combat climate change and prosper human
  development are manifested in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development
  Goals (SDGs), respectively. These are inherently inter-linked as progress towards
  some of these objectives may accelerate or hinder progress towards others. We investigate
  how these two agendas influence each other by defining networks of 18 nodes, consisting
  of the 17 SDGs and climate change, for various groupings of countries. We compute
  a non-linear measure of conditional dependence, the partial distance correlation,
  given any subset of the remaining 16 variables. These correlations are treated as
  weights on edges, and weighted eigenvector centralities are calculated to determine
  the most important nodes. \n\nWe find that SDG 6, clean water and sanitation, and
  SDG 4, quality education, are most central across nearly all groupings of countries.
  In developing regions, SDG 17, partnerships for the goals, is strongly connected
  to the progress of other objectives in the two agendas whilst, somewhat surprisingly,
  SDG 8, decent work and economic growth, is not as important in terms of eigenvector
  centrality."

paper_title: A CONTINUAL LEARNING APPROACH FOR LOCAL LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
  IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS
abstract: 'An increasingly important dimension in the quest for mitigation and monitoring
  of environmental change is the role of citizens. The crowd-based monitoring of local
  level anthropogenic alterations is essential towards measurable changes in different
  contributing factors to climate change. With the proliferation of mobile technologies
  here in the African continent, it is useful to have machine learning based models
  that are deployed on mobile devices and that can learn continually from streams
  of data over extended time, possibly pertaining to different tasks of interest.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the localisation of deforestation indicators using
  lightweight models and extend to incorporate data about wildÔ¨Åres and smoke detection.
  The idea is to show the need and potential of continual learning approaches towards
  building robust models to track local environmental alterations.

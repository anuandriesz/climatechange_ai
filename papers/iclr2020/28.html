paper_title: 'Nutrient demand, Risk and Climate change: Evidence from historical rice
  yield trials in India'
abstract: 'We use data from historical agronomic fertilizer trials to identify the
  effect of climate change on the average rice yield and the yield variability in
  India. The contribution of this paper is three folds: firstly, it has a methodological
  contribution by modelling the input conditional yield densities using a stochastic
  production structure for a developing country like India. In doing so, it predicts
  and measure the effects of climate change on rice grown in tropical regions; secondly,it
  estimates the nutrient demand and its link with the climate change; thirdly, by
  modelling the yield uncertainty, it characterizes the risk and role for insurance
  as a tool for tackling climate change in the developing countries.'

paper_title: Missing-insensitive Short-term Load Forecasting Leveraging Autoencoder
  and LSTM
abstract: Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is fundamental for power system operation,
  demand response, and also greenhouse gas emission reduction. So far, most deep learning-based
  STLF techniques require intact data, but many real-world datasets contain missing
  values due to various reasons, and thus missing imputation using deep learning is
  actively studied. However, missing imputation and STLF have been considered independently
  so far. In this paper, we jointly consider missing imputation and STLF and propose
  a family of autoencoder/LSTM combined models to realize missing-insensitive STLF.
  Specifically, autoencoder (AE), denoising autoencoder (DAE), and convolutional autoencoder
  (CAE) are investigated for extracting features, which is directly fed into the input
  of LSTM. Our results show that three proposed autoencoder/LSTM combined models significantly
  improve forecasting accuracy compared to the baseline models of deep neural network
  and LSTM. Furthermore, the proposed CAE/LSTM combined model outperforms all other
  models for 5%-25% of random missing data.

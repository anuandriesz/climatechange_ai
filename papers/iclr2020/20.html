paper_title: YOU FORGOT IT IN THE GENOTYPE, MODELING TOWARDS ADAPTATION OF FOOD CROPS
  UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE THREAT
abstract: Agriculture is facing the disastrous effects of frequent drastic climate
  changes. Efforts have increased towards the implementation of inexpensive solutions
  for crop-yield prediction using publicly available data to prevent severe long-term
  problems like food scarcity and security, amongst others. Agricultural productiv-
  ity is intrinsic to the choice of plant species (i.e. cultivar) and represents oppor-
  tunity cost for farm managers. The currently used cultivars have been artificially
  selected for productivity at the expense of not being flexible to survive drastic
  cli- mate changes. Current state-of-the-art machine learning models have modelled
  holistically all agricultural counterparts (i.e. soil, management, weather, crop
  cul- tivars etc), albeit, oversimplifying some of the biological features of their
  culti- vars without taking advantage of their data properties. Specifically, these
  models oversimplify some biological features like the genotype making them irrelevant
  or depicting incomplete conclusions since not all of the information from the cul-
  tivar is incorporated. With the goal of creating new models that perform well on
  the yield prediction task in unstable weather conditions (e.g. under the effect
  of climate change), here the authors argue for the importance of incorporating additional
  biological features inferred from the genotype, like stability, and hy- pothesise
  that current state-of-the-art models for grain-yield prediction are blind to such
  features, and hence not applicable in such scenario.

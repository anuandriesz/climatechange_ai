paper_title: 'WeatherBench: A benchmark dataset for data-driven weather forecasting'
abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are a crucial prerequisite for climate change
  adaptation. Can these be provided by deep learning? First studies show promise,
  but the lack of a common dataset and evaluation metrics make inter-comparison between
  the proposed models difficult. In fact, despite the recent research surge in data-driven
  weather forecasting, there is currently no standard approach for evaluating the
  proposed models. Here we introduce WeatherBench, a benchmark dataset for data-driven
  medium-range weather forecasting. We provide data derived from an archive of assimilated
  earth observations for the last 40 years that has been processed to facilitate the
  use in machine learning models. We propose a simple and clear evaluation metric
  which will enable a direct comparison between different proposed methods. Further,
  we provide baseline scores from simple linear regression techniques, purely physical
  forecasting models as well as existing deep learning weather forecasting models.
  All data and code are made publicly available along with tutorials for getting started.
  We believe WeatherBench will provide a useful and reproducible way of evaluating
  data-driven weather forecasting models and we hope that it will accelerate research
  in this direction.

paper_title: Wavelet-Powered Neural Networks for Turbulence
abstract: 'One of the fundamental driving phenomena for climate effects is fluid turbulence
  in geophysical flows. Modeling these flows and explaining its associated spatio-temporal
  phenomena are notoriously difficult tasks. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe
  all the details of the fluid motions, but require accounting for unfeasibly many
  degrees of freedom in the regime of developed turbulence. Model reduction and surrogate
  modeling of turbulence is a general methodology aiming to circumvent this curse
  of dimensionality. Originally driven by phenomenological considerations,  multiple
  attempts to model-reduce NS equations got a new boost recently with Deep Learning
  (DL), trained on the ground truth data, e.g. extracted from high-fidelity Direct
  Numerical Simulations (DNS). However, early attempts of building NNs to model turbulence
  has also revealed its lack of interpretability as the most significant shortcoming.
  In this paper we address the key challenge of devising reduced but, at least partially,
  interpretable model. We take advantage of the balance between strong mathematical
  foundations and the physical interpretability of wavelet theory to build a spatio-temporally
  reduced dynamical map which fuses wavelet based spatial decomposition with spatio-temporal
  modeling based on Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (C-LSTM) architecture.  It
  is shown that the wavelet-based NN makes progress in scaling to large flows, by
  reducing computational costs and GPU memory requirements. '

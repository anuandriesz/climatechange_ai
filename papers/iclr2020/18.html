paper_title: Machine Learning Approaches to Safeguarding Continuous Water Supply in
  the Arid and Semi-arid Lands of Northern Kenya
abstract: Arid and semi-arid regions (ASALs) in developing countries are heavily affected
  by the effects of global warming and climate change, leading to adverse climatic
  conditions such as drought and flooding. This paper explores the problem of fresh-water
  access in northern Kenya and measures being taken to safeguard water access despite
  these harsh climatic changes. We present an integrated water management and decision-support
  platform, eMaji Manager, that we developed and deployed in five ASAL counties in
  northern Kenya to manage waterpoint access for people and livestock. We then propose
  innovative machine learning methods for understanding waterpoint usage and repair
  patterns for sensor-instrumented waterpoints (e.g., boreholes).  We explore sub-sequence
  discriminatory models and recurrent neural networks to predict water-point failures,
  improve repair response times and ultimately support continuous access to water.

paper_title: Hurricane Nowcasting with Irregular Time-step using Neural-ODE and Video
  Prediction
abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of extreme climate events is critical especially
  in the recent globally warming environment. Considering recent advancements in deep
  neural networks, it is worthwhile to tackle this problem as data-driven spatio-temporal
  prediction using neural networks. However, a nontrivial challenge in practice lies
  in irregular time gaps between which climate observation data are collected due
  to sensor errors and other issues. This paper proposes an approach for spatio-temporal
  hurricane prediction that can address this issue of irregular time gaps in collected
  data with a simple but robust end-to-end model based on Neural Ordinary Differential
  Equation and video prediction model based on Retrospective Cycle-GAN.

paper_title: MACHINE   LEARNING   APPLICATIONS   THAT CAN HELP PASTORAL COMMUNITIES
  IN NORTHERN  KENYA  AND  ELSEWHERE  ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE
abstract: I propose the use of Machine Learning techniques such as Active Learning(AL)
  and Transfer Learning(TL) to translate climate information and adaption technique
  from major Western and Asian languages to thousands of low resource languages in
  the developing world. Studies have shown that access to information can help people
  assess the magnitude of the climate change challenge, possible options and those
  feasible within the relevant context (Nyahunda & Tiri-vangasi, 2019) I endeavor
  to demonstrate that if this information was available in a language the locals can
  understand, it would result in local empowerment and as a result inspire action.

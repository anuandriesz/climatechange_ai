paper_title: 'Xingu: Explaining critical geospatial predictions in weak supervision
  for climate finance'
abstract: "Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) play a crucial key role in
  the decision-making of climate investors, policymakers and conservationists. \nRemote
  sensing is commonly used for MRV but practical solutions are constrained by a lack
  of labels to train machine learning-based downstream tasks. Recent work leverages
  weak supervision to alleviate the problem of labelled data scarcity. However, the
  definition of weak supervision signals is limited by the existence of millions of
  possible heuristic-based feature generation rules. Furthermore, these rules are
  often difficult to interpret for climate finance and underperform in critical data
  subsets. We propose Xingu, an interpretable MRV system to explain weak supervision
  rules using game-theoretic SHAP values for critical model predictions. Moreover,
  Xingu enables domain experts to collectively design and share labelling functions,
  thus curating a reusable knowledge base for weak supervision signals."

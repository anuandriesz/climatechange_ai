paper_title: Advancing Renewable Electricity Consumption With Reinforcement Learning
abstract: As the share of renewable energy sources in the present electric energy
  mix rises, their intermittence proves to be the biggest challenge to carbon free
  electricity generation. To address this challenge, we propose an electricity pricing
  agent, which sends price signals to the customers and contributes to shifting the
  customer demand to periods of high renewable energy generation. We propose an implementation
  of a pricing agent with a reinforcement learning approach where the environment
  is represented by the customers, the electricity generation utilities and the weather
  conditions.

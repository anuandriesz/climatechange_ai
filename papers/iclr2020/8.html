paper_title: 'DETECTION OF HOUSING AND AGRICULTURE AREAS ON DRY-RIVERBEDS FOR THE
  EVALUATION OF RISK BY LANDSLIDES USING LOW-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY BASED ON
  DEEP LEARNING. STUDY ZONE: LIMA, PERU'
abstract: The expansion of human settlements in Peru has caused risk exposure to landslides.
  However, this risk could increase because the intensity of the El ni침o phenomenon
  will be greater in the coming years,  increasing rainfall on the Peruvian coast.
  In this paper, we present a novel methodology for detecting housing areas and agricultural
  lands in low-resolution satellite imagery in order to analyze potential risk in
  case of unexpected landslides. It was developed by creating two datasets from Lima
  Metropolitana in Peru, one of which is for detecting dry riverbeds and agriculture
  lands, and the other for classifying housing areas. We applied data augmentation
  based on geometrical methods and trained architectures based on U-net methods separately
  and then, overlap the results for risk assessment. We found that there are areas
  with significant potential risk that have been classified by the Peruvian government
  as medium or low risk areas. On this basis, it is recommended obtain a dataset with
  better resolution that can identify how many housing areas will be affected and
  take the appropriate prevention measures. Further research in post-processing is
  needed for suppress noise in our results.

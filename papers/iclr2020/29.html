paper_title: USING MACHINE LEARNING TO ANALYZE CLIMATE CHANGE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
  (CCTT)
abstract: 'The objective of the present paper is to review the climate change technology
  transfer. This research proposes a method for analysing CCTT using patent analysis
  and topic modelling. A collection of climate change mitigation related technology
  (CCMT) patents from patent databases would be used as input to group patents in
  several relevant topics for climate change mitigation using the topic exploration
  model in this research. The research questions we want to address are: how have
  the patenting activities changed over time in CCMT patents? And who are the technological
  leaders? The investigation of these questions can offer the technological landscape
  in climate change-related technologies at the international level. We propose a
  hybrid Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach for topic modelling and identification
  of relationships between terms and topics related to CCMT, enabling better visualizations
  of underlying intellectual property dynamics. Further, we propose predictive modelling
  for CCTT and competitor analysis to identify and rank countries with a similar patent
  landscape. The projected results are expected to facilitate the transfer process
  associated with existing and emerging climate change technologies and improve technology
  cooperation between governments.'

paper_title: Accelerated  Data Discovery for Scalable Climate Action
abstract: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the planet
  must decarbonize by 50% by 2030 in order to keep global warming below 1.5C. This
  goal calls for a prompt and massive deployment of solutions in all societal sectors
  - research, governance, finance, commerce, health care, consumption. One challenge
  for experts and non-experts is access to the rapidly growing body of relevant information,
  which is currently scattered across many weakly linked domains of expertise. We
  propose a large-scale, semi-automatic, AI-based discovery system to collect, tag,
  and semantically index this information. The ultimate goal is a near real-time,
  partially curated data catalog of global climate information for rapidly scalable
  climate action.

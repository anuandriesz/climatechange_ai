paper_title: Towards a unified standards for smart infrastructure datasets
abstract: Development of smart devices and smart home appliances allowed us to harness
  more data about energy patterns inside households, overtime this amount will increase.
  There are contributions published to address building datasets, working for objective
  of energy consumption optimization. Yet there are still factors if included could
  help in understanding problem better. This proposal tries to annotate missing features
  that if applied could help in a better understanding energy consumption in smart
  buildings impact on environment. Second, to have a unified standards that help different
  solutions to be compared properly.

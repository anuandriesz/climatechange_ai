paper_title: 'SMArtCast: Predicting soil moisture interpolations into the future using
  Earth observation data in a deep learning framework'
abstract: 'Soil moisture is critical component of crop health and monitoring it can
  enable further actions for increasing yield or preventing catastrophic die off.
  As climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather events and reduces
  the predictability of weather, and non-optimal soil moistures for crops may become
  more likely. In this work, we use a series of LSTM architectures to analyze measurements
  of soil moisture and vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. The system
  learns to predict the future values of these measurements. These spatially sparse
  values and indices are used as input features to an interpolation method that infer
  spatially dense moisture maps at multiple depths for a future time point. This has
  the potential to provide advance warning for soil moistures that may be inhospitable
  to crops across an area with limited monitoring capacity. '

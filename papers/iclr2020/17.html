paper_title: 'Benchmarks for Grid Flexibility Prediction: Enabling Progress and Machine
  Learning Applications'
abstract: Decarbonizing the grid is recognized worldwide as one of the objectives
  for the next decades. Its success depends on our ability to massively deploy renewable
  resources, but to fully benefit from those, grid flexibility is needed. In this
  paper we put forward the design of a benchmark that will allow for the systematic
  measurement of demand response programs' effectiveness, information that we do not
  currently have. Furthermore, we explain how the proposed benchmark will facilitate
  the use of Machine Learning techniques in grid flexibility applications.

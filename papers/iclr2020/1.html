paper_title: 'BISCUIT: Building Intelligent System Customer Investment Tools'
abstract: Energy use in buildings account for approximately half of global electricity
  consumption and a significant amount of CO2 emissions. Often, the higher energy
  usage in buildings are accounted to old and poorly maintained infrastructure and
  equipments. On the other hand, Smart buildings are capable of achieving energy efficiency
  by using intelligent services such as indoor positioning, personalized lighting,
  demand-based heating ventilation and air-conditioning, automatic fault detection
  and recovery etc. However, most buildings nowadays lack the basic components and
  infrastructure to support such services. The investment decision of intelligent
  system design and retrofit can be a daunting task, because it involves both hardware
  (sensors, actuators, servers) and software (operating systems, service algorithms),
  which have issues of compatibility, functionality constraints, and opportunities
  of co-design of synergy. Our work proposes a user-oriented investment decision toolset
  using optimization and machine learning techniques aimed at handling the complexity
  of exploration in the large design space and to enhance cost-effectiveness, energy
  efficiency, and human-centric values. The toolset is demonstrated in a case study
  to retrofit a medium-sized building, where it is shown to propose a design that
  significantly lowers the overall investment cost while achieving user specifications.

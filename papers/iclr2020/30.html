paper_title: Using ML to close the vocabulary gap in the context of environment and
  climate change in Chichewa
abstract: 'In the west, alienation from nature and deteriorating opportunities to
  experience it, have led educators to incorporate educational programs in schools,
  to bring pupils in contact with nature and to enhance their understanding of issues
  related to the environment and its protection. In Africa, and in Malawi, where most
  people engage in agriculture, and spend most of their time in the ''outdoors'',
  alienation from nature is happening too, although in different ways.  Large portion
  of the indigenous vocabulary and knowledge remains unknown or is slowly disappearing,
  and there is a need to build a glossary of terms regarding environment and climate
  change in the vernacular to improve the dialog regarding climate change and environmental
  protection.. We believe that ML has a role to play in closing the ‘vocabulary gap’
  of terms and concepts regarding the environment and climate change that exists in
  Chichewa and other Malawian languages by helping to creating a visual dictionary
  of key terms used to describe the environment and explain the issues involved in
  climate change and their meaning. Chichewa is a descriptive language, one English
  term may be translated using several words. Thus, the task is not to detect just
  literal translations, but also translations by means of ‘descriptions’ and illustrations
  and thus extract correspondence between terms and definitions and to  measure how
  appropriate a term is to convey the meaning intended.  As part of this project,
  ML can be used to identify ‘loanword patterns’, which may be useful in understanding
  the transmission of cultural items.

paper_title: Prediction of Bayesian Intervals for Tropical Storms
abstract: 'Building on recent research for prediction of hurricane trajectories using
  recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we have developed improved methods and generalized
  the approach to predict a confidence interval region of the trajectory utilizing
  Bayesian methods. Tropical storms are capable of causing severe damage, so accurately
  predicting their trajectories can bring significant benefits to cities and lives,
  especially as they grow more intense due to climate change effects. By implementing
  the Bayesian confidence interval using dropout in an RNN, we improve the actionability
  of the predictions, for example by estimating the areas to evacuate in the landfall
  region. We used an RNN to predict the trajectory of the storms at 6-hour intervals.
  We used latitude, longitude, windspeed, and pressure features from a Statistical
  Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) dataset of about 500 tropical storms
  in the Atlantic Ocean. Our results show how neural network dropout values affect
  our predictions and Bayesian intervals. '

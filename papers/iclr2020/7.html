paper_title: Embedding Hard Physical Constraints in Convolutional Neural Networks
  for 3D Turbulence
abstract: Deep learning approaches have shown much promise for climate sciences, especially
  in dimensionality reduction and compression of large datasets. A major issue in
  deep learning of climate phenomena, like geophysical turbulence, is the lack of
  physical guarantees.  In this work, we propose a general framework to directly embed
  the notion of incompressible fluids into Convolutional Neural Networks, for coarse-graining
  of turbulence. These \textbf{physics-embedded neural networks} leverage interpretable
  strategies from numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics to enforce physical
  laws and boundary conditions by taking advantage the mathematical properties of
  the underlying equations. We demonstrate results on 3D fully-developed turbulence,
  showing that the \textit{physics-aware inductive bias} drastically improves local
  conservation of mass, without sacrificing performance according to several other
  metrics characterizing the fluid flow.

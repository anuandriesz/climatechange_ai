paper_title: 'SolarNet: A Deep Learning Framework to Map Solar Plants In China From
  Satellite Imagery'
abstract: Renewable energy such as solar power is critical to fight the ever more
  serious climate, how to effectively detect renewable energy has became an important
  issue for governments. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework named
  SolarNet which is designed to perform semantic segmentation on large scale satellite
  imagery data to detect solar farms. SolarNet has successfully mapped 439 solar farms
  in China, covering near 2000 square kilometers, equivalent to the size of whole
  Shenzhen city or two and a half of New York city. To the best of our knowledge,
  it is the first time that we used deep learning to reveal the locations and sizes
  of solar farms in China, which could provide insights for solar power companies,
  climate finance and markets.

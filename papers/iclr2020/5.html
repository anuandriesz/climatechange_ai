paper_title: Understanding the dynamics of climate-crucial food choice behaviours
  using Distributional Semantics
abstract: |-
  Developed countries must make swift movements toward plant-based diets in order to mitigate climate change and maintain food security. However, researchers
  currently lack clear insight into the psychological dimensions that influence food
  choice, which is necessary to encourage the societal adaptation of new diets. In
  this project, we use Skip-gram word embeddings trained on the ukWaC corpus
  as a lens to study the implicit mental representations people have of foods. Our
  data-driven insights expand on findings from traditional, interview-based studies
  by uncovering implicit mental representations, allowing a better understanding the
  complex combination of conscious and sub-conscious processes surrounding food
  choice. In particular, our findings shed light on the pervasiveness of meat as the
  ‘centre’ of the meal in the UK.

paper_title: Indigenous Knowledge Aware Drought Monitoring, Forecasting and Prediction
  Using Deep Learning Techniques
abstract: 'The general objective of this proposed research work is to design deep
  learning based hybrid comprehensive framework for drought monitoring, forecasting
  and prediction using scientific and indigenous knowledge as an integration of connectionist
  and symbolic AI. In Ethiopia, among all extreme climate events, drought is considered
  as the most complex phenomenon affecting the country and its impact is also high
  due to absence of locally grounded intelligent and explainable technology-oriented
  drought early warning and monitoring system. Thus, studying Ethiopic perspective
  of drought monitoring and prediction in line with continental and global climate
  change is vital for drought impact minimization and sustainable development of the
  country. Moreover, having technology assisted early protective, preventative action
  is also many times cheaper than the associated response to humanitarian crisis.
  Accordingly, this proposed work will have different expected outputs, including:
  drought risk identification, drought monitoring, drought preparedness, drought forecasting,
  drought mitigation, and post drought best practice recommendation models with interactive
  visualizations and explanations. '

paper_title: A Machine Learning Pipeline to Predict Vegetation Health
abstract: Agricultural droughts can exacerbate poverty and lead to famine. Timely
  distribution of disaster relief funds is essential to help minimise the impact of
  drought. Indices of vegetation health are indicative of higher risk of agricultural
  drought, but their prediction remains challenging, particularly in Africa. Here,
  we present an open-source machine learning pipeline for climate-related data. Specifically,
  we train and analyse a recurrent model to predict pixel-wise vegetation health in
  Kenya.

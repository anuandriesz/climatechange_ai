paper_title: Deep Reinforcement Learning based Renewable Energy Error Compensable
  Forecasting
abstract: Recently, renewable energy is rapidly integrated into the power grid to
  prevent climate change, and accurate forecasting of renewable generation becomes
  critical for reliable power system operation. However, existing forecasting algorithms
  only focused on reducing forecasting errors without considering error compensability
  by using a large-scale battery. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy called
  error compensable forecasting. We switch the objective of forecasting from reducing
  errors to making errors compensable by leveraging a battery. Specifically, we propose
  a deep reinforcement learning based framework having forecasting in the loop of
  control. Extensive simulations show that the proposed one-hour ahead forecasting
  achieves zero error for more than 98% of time while reducing the operational expenditure
  by up to 44%.

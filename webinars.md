    Climate change mitigation requires substantial investment, technology development and political effort. However, this large-scale task cannot be accomplished without considering important ethical and social considerations. Climate change mitigation should be accomplished in such a way that historically marginalized and vulnerable groups across the world have equitable access to mitigation technologies, financial incentives, and social rewards. How can this goal be achieved? Is data science and AI useful for this purpose? In this webinar, we will learn from the panelists in industry and academia and will aim to identify challenges and opportunities for AI in this field.

          How can machine learning help decarbonize the power sector? Join us for a
          conversation with leaders from academia, startups, and the power industry,
          who will share insights from their own work in this space, as well as
          advice on how to make the leap from innovation to deployment. This webinar
          is co-hosted by Climate Change AI and the Energy Innovation Network.
          Speakers include:<br><br>

          <a href="http://www.kyrib.com/" target="_blank"><b>Dr. Kyri Baker</b></a>
          received her B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
          from Carnegie Mellon University in 2009, 2010, and 2014, respectively. From
          2015 to 2017, she worked at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Since
          Fall 2017, she has been an Assistant Professor at the University of
          Colorado Boulder. Dr. Baker is a Fellow of the Renewable and Sustainable
          Energy Institute (RASEI). Her research focuses on renewable energy
          integration by changing the way the electric power grid operates. In
          particular, she develops computationally efficient optimization and
          learning algorithms for energy systems ranging from building-level assets
          to transmission grids.<br><br>

          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erichsieh1/" target="_blank"><b>Eric
          Hsieh</b></a> is the Head of Product for AI/ML Applications for AutoGrid,
          an energy industry software company. Previously working as a Sr. Machine
          Learning Engineer for AutoGrid, he built and deployed a Predictive
          Maintenance model at a Fortune 500 energy company that catches distribution
          outages with IoT data in realtime. Now, as the Head of Product, Eric aims
          to make the energy grid more efficient by productizing AI applications. He
          received his formal education in Evolutionary Biology from the University
          of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he founded a biofuel startup that made
          energy from brewery wastewater. In his free time, Eric enjoys gardening and
          golfing.<br><br>

          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-marot/"
          target="_blank"><b>Antoine Marot</b></a> is the lead AI scientist at RTE,
          the French transmission system operator. He holds a double master’s degree
          in Engineering from Ecole Centrale Paris and Stanford University. After
          interning at Tesla Motors, he joined RTE R&D on the Apogee project 6 years
          ago, with the long-term goal of developing a personal assistant for control
          room operators with AI. Through collaboration with INRIA (the French AI
          research lab), he supervised several PhD students on augmented power system
          simulators with AI, and on Human-Intelligent Machine interactions with a
          strong focus on interpretability. He recently co-authored several papers
          using AI for power systems and has given talks on the topic at various
          venues, including a keynote at the IJCNN AI conference. He advocates for a
          new "AI for power systems community" bringing together researchers from
          both fields to accelerate the application of AI. The “Learning to Run a
          Power Network” challenge running along NeurIPS 2020, the largest AI
          conference, is a strong step forward towards it.<br><br>

          teams at Cisco Systems. Kaitlyn also graduated from Stanford with
          coursework in Economics and Finance. She has previous experience working in
          finance at J.P. Morgan and also ran a nonprofit in the Sustainable Food
          space. Each bringing unique skill sets to the table, Vik and Kaitlyn are
          passionate about bringing the digital transformation to a traditional
          industry with a burning need to modernize the aging grid infrastructure and
          to put an end to some of the mass disasters such as wildfires, forced
          shutdowns, and network failures as a result of failed
          infrastructure.<br><br>

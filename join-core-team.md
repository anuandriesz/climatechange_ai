# Join the CCAI Core Team!

Climate Change AI (CCAI) is an organization to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning by providing education and infrastructure, building a community, and advancing discourse.

CCAI is looking for new core team members to support the organizationâ€™s ongoing activities. Core team members are expected to dedicate at least 5 hours of volunteer time per week and work closely with other members of the organization.

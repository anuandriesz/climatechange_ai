# Join the CCAI Core Team!

CCAI is looking for new core team members to play leading roles in the organization’s ongoing activities. Core team members are expected to dedicate at least 5 hours of volunteer time per week and work closely with other members of the organization. Most [core team members](/about#people) have a background in either machine learning or areas relevant to climate change (such as energy, transportation, climate science, etc.), and a strong interest in both topics. We are currently recruiting for the following open positions:

<ul class='buttons' id='recruitment-subnav'>
</ul>

<script>
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('.main-content h3').each((idx, el) => {
    $('#recruitment-subnav').append(`<a class='button' href='#${el.id}'>${$(el).text()}</a>`);
  });
});
</script>

Applications should be submitted [here](/core-team-application).

To be considered for a core team role, we require the following:
1. **Mission alignment:** Team members must be passionate about catalyzing impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning, per our [mission and goals](/about).
2. **Proactiveness and responsibility:** Team members must be proactive and responsible to ensure our organization can run as effectively as possible.
3. **Time commitment:** Team members are expected to dedicate around 5 hours of volunteer time per week, including conference calls, and be responsive on Slack.
4. **Attention to detail:** Team members are mindful of the work that they carry out, which helps CCAI ensure high quality of its activities. 
5. **Team ethic:** Team members must be able to work productively and collaboratively with team members, and otherwise foster a collegial environment. 
6. **Comfort working in a digital environment:** CCAI’s team is based across the world, and communicates primarily using Slack and video conferencing tools. While we are happy to on-board newcomers to the particular technologies we use, core team members must in general be comfortable working and collaborating in a primarily digital environment.
7. **Curiosity:** CCAI is always embarking on new ventures and looking for new projects. We encourage new ideas from within (and outside) the team! 

Climate change is a global problem that requires global thinking. We accept applications from anywhere in the world. While CCAI organizes in-person events from time to time, all of the core work is done remotely. We don’t require a specific degree, if you are responsible and enthusiastic, there may be a place for you on the core team.

CCAI is a fast-moving and fun environment to help facilitate meaningful and immediate climate action with machine learning. Working with CCAI will provide you with opportunities to acquire new skills, expand your network, and curate knowledge. We are an interdisciplinary and international team and believe that diversity, inclusion, and equity are not only fundamental to the organization but also to progress in addressing climate change as a whole.
 
Below is a list of roles in which CCAI is especially interested at the moment. Please apply by filling out [this application form](/core-team-application). If you are interested in joining but do not fit any of the specific roles, we still encourage you to apply and describe in your application how you see yourself contributing to CCAI. We would be particularly excited to hear from general applications with experience in social science, economics, heavy industry, biodiversity and conservation, agriculture, and resilience, entrepreneurship, and public policy. Applications will be assessed on a rolling basis.
